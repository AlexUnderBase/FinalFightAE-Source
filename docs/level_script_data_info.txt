$0062e0 or $006308 depending on region switch... - In game level data pointer table 

$006330 - Intro level data pointer table

Each table contains entries to determine the offset of the script data for each sub level.

For example, slums table looks as so for the intro level script data:

$06EC14 - $0006, $00A2, $0114

Meaning sub level 0 is $6 bytes out (just after the indexes), sub level 1 $A2 bytes and sub level 2 $114 bytes out.

Each level script entry is $e bytes long, here is an example from the intro of the slums:

0011 2233 4455 66 77 88 99 AA BB CC DD
AAAA XXXX YYYY    TT SS             BB
0000 0518 00B8 08 01 03 00 00 00 00 00

Where each labeled field is as follows:

A (w) - Active, a negative value here means the end of a level script
X (w) - X position
Y (w) - Y position
T (b) - Type
S (b) - Sub Type
B (b) - Both players must be active
